The benchmark of FAP instances generated for the paper "Multi-objectivising Combinatorial Optimisation Problems by means of Elementary Landscape Decomposition" consist of 45 instances with the following configurations (5 instances of each):
25x5, 25x10, 25x15, 50x15, 50x30, 50x45, 75x20, 75x40 and 75x60.

Due to the limited file size storage available on GitHub, the instances for the last four types (20 instances in total) are not accesible via GitHub. In order to get these instances, write an email to the author of the paper josu.ceberio@ehu.eus and he will provide the material needed.
